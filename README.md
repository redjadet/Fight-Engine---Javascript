Fight-Engine---Javascript
=========================

This project is done in weekend in few days as a fun project :)

Written in javascript and partly html to make a fight engine similar to old street fighter, mortal combat games.
Very easy to add new characters by just adding sprites png, sound effect as mp3. 
To add new character just add needed information in JSON structure in fe.players.js file.
Currently, two characters are doing same moves when action keys are pressed but it can be changed easily.

Open 'newindex.html' file in browser to run the game. 

Hope you like it :)
